WooCommerce Custom Product Taxonomies (discontinued)
===================================

# This plugin is discontinued. I strongly recommend that you use my new plugin [Post Types Creator]( https://github.com/pelmered/post-types-creator) instead.

Just drop this into your plugins folder, edit the $taxonomies variable(taxonomy names) in woocommerce-custom-taxonomy.php and then activate the plugin. It could not be any simpler to add custom taxonomies to your WooCommerce products!
